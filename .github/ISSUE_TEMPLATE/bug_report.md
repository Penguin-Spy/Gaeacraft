**Before you report, please read this (and then remove it [I will judge you if you don't])**
1. Has someone already reported this issue? Make sure when you search for duplicates to search in closed issues as well.
2. Is this actually a bug? There is a separate template for feature requests. If it is not a glitch, but its an issue with gameplay features or progression, that would still go here.
3. Is this the right place to report the bug? If the issue also occurs in vanilla Minecraft *in the same way*, please report it on the [official feedback site](https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/).
4. Put the Minecraft version in the title (eg "[1.16.2]: Terrain generation doesn't exist").
