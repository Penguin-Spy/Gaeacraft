This copy is an Adapted version of this datapack, modified by Penguin_Spy to be compatible with the Gaeacraft datapack that this is included in.
The changes include:
    Creating checks for a tag where necessary to allow a chest_minecart to be used instead of a barrel as the inventory,
    adding/modifying/creating copies of data commands to access a chest_minecart where the above mentioned tags are found,
    pointing to functions in the gaeacraft namespace to resolve recipes instead of using the functions created by the generator,
    using the shulker_boxes at 1 0 0 and 2 0 0 instead of 16942001 1 -14269007 for item copying and insertion,
    using the oak_sign at 0 0 0 for resolving the JSON text component "nbt",
    using feathers as placeholder items instead of white_stained_glass & white_stained_glass_panes,
    and muting the message shown on /reload, as credits to all of the creators are given in the Minecraft credits (accessable from the title screen by clicking Mojang's copyright notice).
This license file has also been moved inside the custom_crafting_table namespace,
as all data outside of it that was created by the generator is not used because of the modifications listed above.
