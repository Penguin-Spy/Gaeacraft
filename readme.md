**WARNING: THE DATAPACK IS IN ALPHA, THERE IS NO GUARANTEE THAT THE DATAPACK WILL BE FUNCTIONAL AT ANY MOMENT, OR THAT IT WILL NOT PERMANENTLY CORRUPT YOUR WORLD**
well hopefully it doesnt corrupt your world, but y'know, be careful, stuff might not (probably wont) be fully functional after any given commit.
just be careful :)

# Gaeacraft
Survival mode, expanded.

This is a datapack with a similar goal to Terrafirmacraft: expand the survival experience to be more realistic, engaging, and have more levels of progression.
I plan on having much more content than the base Terrafirmacraft, probably more like the modpack Terrafirmapunk, with all sorts of technology, grinding, and weird gimmicks and gadgets.
The datapack is in alpha, so there isn't much actual gameplay yet. Check out the wiki for more info.

# Installation
Because the datapack is in alpha and pretty much not playable in survival yet (no terrain generation), there are no releases. If you would like to use the datapack, here are the instructions:
1. Create a folder named `Gaeacraft` in both your `resourcepacks` folder and the `datapacks` folder of a newly created world (again, no terrain gen, so just make a superflat or something).
2. Copy pack.mcmeta to both of these folders.
3. Copy the `assets` folder to `resourcepacks/Gaeacraft/` and copy the `data` folder to `datapacks/Gaeacraft/`.
4. Open Minecraft, enable the resourcepack in the settings menu, and then open the world (or do `/reload`).
5. Profit? Idk why you would want the datapack in its alpha state, but now you have it!
